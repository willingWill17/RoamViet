# Enhanced Daily Planning Features

## Overview

The schedule creation system has been enhanced to include detailed daily planning with **custom time phases**, activities, and notes. Users can create their own time phases instead of being limited to fixed periods.

## New Features

### 1. Custom Time-Based Planning

- **Flexible Time Phases**: Create your own time phases (e.g., "Early Morning", "Breakfast", "Sightseeing", "Lunch Break", "Afternoon Tour", "Dinner", "Night Market")
- **Time Ranges**: Optionally specify time ranges for each phase (e.g., "9:00-12:00", "2:30-5:00 PM")
- **Unlimited Phases**: Add as many time phases as needed for each day
- **Phase Management**: Easily add, remove, and rename time phases

### 2. Activity Management

- Add multiple activities per custom time phase
- Each activity includes:
  - Activity name
  - Detailed notes (location, costs, etc.)
- Remove activities with one click
- Expandable/collapsible daily plans

### 3. User Interface

- Interactive daily planning cards
- Real-time updates when dates change
- Custom time phase creation and editing
- Responsive design for all devices

## Technical Details

### Data Structure

```javascript
dailyPlans = {
  "2024-01-15": {
    timePhases: [
      {
        name: "Early Morning",
        timeRange: "6:00-9:00",
        activities: [
          { name: "Temple Visit", notes: "Entry fee: $5, Dress modestly" },
        ],
      },
      {
        name: "Brunch & Shopping",
        timeRange: "10:00-14:00",
        activities: [
          { name: "Local Market", notes: "Try street food, Budget: $20" },
          { name: "Souvenir Shopping", notes: "Look for handmade crafts" },
        ],
      },
      {
        name: "Evening Relaxation",
        timeRange: "18:00-22:00",
        activities: [
          { name: "Sunset Viewing", notes: "Best spot: Hill viewpoint" },
        ],
      },
    ],
  },
};
```

### API Integration

- Custom time phases are converted to the existing API format
- Each activity includes both `time_phase` (name) and `time_range` fields
- Backward compatible with existing schedules
- Existing schedules are automatically grouped by time phase when edited

## Limitations

- Maximum 30 days for detailed daily planning (to maintain performance)
- Activities are stored as destinations in the existing API structure
- Time phases are per-day (cannot span multiple days)

## Future Enhancements

- Time phase templates and suggestions
- Drag-and-drop reordering of phases and activities
- Duration tracking for activities
- Budget tracking per activity
- Activity templates based on location
- Collaborative real-time editing
- Export to calendar applications
